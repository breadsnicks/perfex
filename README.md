** APSC 103 Project for Queeen's University ** 

Communication services are pivotal towards reliable emergency response services. With a daily rate of approximately 3,250 urgent calls a day within the Toronto Police 
Department, 911 operators are expected to diligently extract caller information and guide dispatching services. However, since calls are frequently presented under unfamiliar 
and intensive conditions, it is important to hire operators that are proficient in multi-tasking, auditory perception, and stress management.

To select suitable candidates for communication services, the Toronto Police Department has relied on “Perfex”: a multi-tasking device that uses various modules to 
examine one’s resilience, speed, accuracy, and attention to detail under stressful conditions. The department acknowledges that Perfex’s development in the 1970s hinders 
its ability to reflect a modern workplace and its technology. This is why an updated version of Perfex with a modern automated grading system, web-based-interface, and 
typing module has been requested and completed to assess candidates’ ability to be a 911 operator.

PERFEX INSTRUCTIONS:
MODULE 1: Short Story Test A | Note Taking Only
Click on "Play Short Story" to listen to a short story. Pay attention to all provided details; you will be allowed to type notes in the white box provided. 
Alternatively, you can record notes on scrap paper. When the audio is completed, you will be required to submit your notes and move onto to the next module. 
You will be allowed to refer to your notes for Short Story Test B.

MODULE 2: Reading Aloud Test | 24 POINTS
In this test, you will be required to reiterate what has been written in the text box provided to you. Click on "Start Recording", speak in the microphone, and click 
on the "Stop Recording" button to stop. You will be able to visualize your words in the white box below. Proceed to the next module by clicking on the 'select button'.
Please record carefully; you will not have a second chance to record.

MODULE 3: Copying Information Test | 25.5 POINTS
Start the module by clicking on the "Play Letter Word Combinations" buttons. 8-10 combinations will be relayed to you. When the audio plays, record each individual 
phrase in the text box, clicking on your keyboard's enter key before moving onto the next combination. If you happen to miss a combination, do not fret. You will not 
lose marks for moving onto the next phrase. Move onto the "Phrases and Sentences" section by clicking on its corresponding button. Note that this section follows a
