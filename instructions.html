        <strong>Abstract:</strong> <!-- Section title -->
        <br>
        Communication services are pivotal towards reliable emergency response services. With a daily rate of approximately 3,250 urgent calls a day within the Toronto Police Department, 911 operators are expected to diligently extract caller information and guide dispatching services. However, since calls are frequently presented under unfamiliar and intensive conditions, it is important to hire operators that are proficient in multi-tasking, auditory perception, and stress management.
        <br> <br>
        To select suitable candidates for communication services, the Toronto Police Department has relied on “Perfex”: a multi-tasking device that uses various modules to examine one’s resilience, speed, accuracy, and attention to detail under stressful conditions. The department acknowledges that Perfex’s development in the 1970s hinders its ability to reflect a modern workplace and its technology. 
        <br> <br>
        Smith Engineering students were tasked to design a modernized version of Perfex. This iteration, designed by Aaron Kleiman, Andrew Heraldo, Julien Chagnon, Jack Marcinow, and Evan Prosserman, consists of an automated grading system, web-based interface, typing module, and an arduino-based taskbox.
        <br> <br>
        The following text will provide detailed instructions for the modules that candidates will be assessed on. If further assistance is required, please feel free to inquire a proctor.
